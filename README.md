# Prediction-Model
This is a very basic machine learning model to predict suicides based on real world data from World Health Organisation
The dataset can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/who-suicide-statistics.
There are three main algorithms used here namely: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
This model has very high RMSE.
As I am a beginner in Machine Learning so I hope you Forgive my errors and mistakes.
Any type of suggessions are welcome.
